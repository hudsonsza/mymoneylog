Is a very simple way to control your finances with the help from your browser, you don't need to be connected to the internet because it runs from your local file system and uses a simple HTML file to store your entries.

It's not a server application, you just unpack in your local drive and open in your browser.

It was designed to replace an $worksheet, and to not depend on external provider, but to be very small and portable.

Nowadays, after some restriction to the way the browsers (Chrome and Firefox) allows file writing from javascript, only MS Internet Explorer can write the data without any external plugin. The Firefox support is only provided with the help of the extension [AsYouWish](https://github.com/brettz9/asyouwish/) from Brett Zamir.
